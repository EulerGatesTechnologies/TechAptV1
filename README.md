## **Task 1: Threading & Data Persistence**

### **Boilerplate Code**

- `TechAptV1.Client/Components/Pages/Threading.razor`
- `TechAptV1.Client/Services/ThreadingService.cs`
- `TechAptV1.Client/Services/DataService.cs`
- `TechAptV1.Client/Models/Number.cs`

### **Required Functionality**

#### **1. Threading.razor – Data Computation UI**

- **Start Button:**
  - Start the data computation process while adhering to UI best practices.
  - Disable the Start button during computation.
  - Enable the Save button only if computation is completed and data is available to save.
- **Save Button:**
  - Save the computed data to an SQLite database.

#### **2. ThreadingService.cs – Compute Data (Business Logic Requirements)**

- Create a thread to randomly pick **odd numbers** and add them to a shared global variable.
- Create a second thread to calculate **prime numbers**, negate them, and add them to the shared global variable.
- Once the shared global variable contains **2,500,000** entries:
  - Create a third thread to pick **even numbers** and add them to the shared global variable.
- Stop all threads when the shared global variable contains exactly **10,000,000** entries.
- Sort the global list in ascending order.
- Display the total count of numbers, odd numbers, and even numbers.
- Retain a handle on the list for user access and saving.
- The shared global variable must not exceed **10,000,000** entries.

#### **3. DataService.cs – Save Data (Persistence Requirements)**

- SQLite table structure:

  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE "Number" (
      "Value" INTEGER NOT NULL,
      "IsPrime" INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0
  );
  ```

- Efficiently insert the global list into the SQLite table.

## **Task 2: Results & Data Retrieval**

### **Boilerplate Code**

- `TechAptV1.Client/Components/Pages/Results.razor`
- `TechAptV1.Client/Services/DataService.cs`
- `TechAptV1.Client/Models/Number.cs`

### **Required Functionality**

#### **1. Results.razor – Data Computation Results UI**

- **Display Table:**
  - Show the top 20 results from the saved data generated in Task 1.
- **DownloadXml Button:**
  - Retrieve all records from the `Number` table.
  - Serialize the records to XML.
  - Provide the XML file for download.
- **DownloadBinary Button:**
  - Retrieve all records from the `Number` table.
  - Serialize the record columns to a binary format (`.bin`).
  - Provide the binary file for download.
